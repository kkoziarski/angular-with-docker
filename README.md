# Angular Docker image on multiple environments
How to build Angular docker image which can be deployed anywhere.

## Build Once, Deploy Anywhere
The problem described here: 
* [M: Multiple environments with Angular and Docker](https://medium.com/voobans-tech-stories/multiple-environments-with-angular-and-docker-2512e342ab5a)
* [GH: Load configuration from external file](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/6711)

## Main points
Load configuration from external file:
```
src\app\core\app-load\app-load.module.ts
src\app\core\app-load\app-load.service.ts
src\app\core\models\app-settings.ts

src\assets\env-config.json
src\assets\env-config.json.template
```
Docker - replace configuration on container run:

```
...

COPY ./.docker/entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh

RUN chmod +x /entrypoint.sh

ENTRYPOINT ["bash", "/entrypoint.sh"]
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```
Replace tokens in the `env-config.json.template` file with those from environment variables passed on runtime in `.docker\tools\docker-run.bat`
```
.docker\entrypoint.sh
```

Docker tools:
```
.docker\tools\docker-build.bat
.docker\tools\docker-run.bat
```
